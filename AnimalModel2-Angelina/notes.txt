Jupyter notebook used to train model is attached in AnimalModel1-Angelina

Dog model from prior sprint is more accurate and precise than the dog class in this model, so that may be used instead in the final product. 

This model used less epochs and a dataset which definitely needs improvement, so in the next sprint I will be refining this model and merging it with Luke's animal model. 

Information about dataset/classes/animals/etc. can be found in roboflow link above.
